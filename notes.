Notes on Feminist Webpage generated by AI 

- Generic contains Header, Body, Footer
- In the About section, the most interesting part it gave me was Work in Progress and some blanks
- It is very kind — user friendly 
- Pretty knowledgeable of the feminism and cyberfeminism histories
- 2022 as a copyright 
- Colors bright pink 
- Favicon venus symbol

Directions to take: 
- Unfinished elements
- Constantly available website
- How to design unavailability? That is not maintenance mode? 
- How to integrate that in a website and when does it become unavailable? 
- Would its unavailability hide the glitches or hide the content? 
- Can it become URGENT related to historic events like protests? 
- Can it become a tool for not always available information ??
- Does its code become unavailable too? 

Next week: 
- I want to explore unavailability — in a new branch 
- 

— WHAT IS WORK IN PROGRESS? 
— make more websites — 
— comparing the code 
— make my website feminist? —> 
— error 404 — what does that history look like ?? — looking for 404 
history of page 404
— internet net less website = WORTHLESS // 

I NEED TO WRITE A PARAGRAPH OF THIS 

** AI CANT UNDERSTAND INCOMPLETENESS // LACK OF INCOMPLETE

AESTHETIC INCOMPLETENESS
— aesthetic can’t represent incompleteness of decision-making— it always needs a human to make a decision that it can represent. Randomness of decisions or LEAVING IT FOR LATER

New machine vision

How could machine learning be deployed as a generator of WHAT? 
RESPONDING TO NEWS, — GENERATE 
— How to conceptualise the 

Glitch is that AI can't produce incompleteness 
incompleteness vs. availability 

benchmarking -- defining the similarity and comparing to what im doing

2 directions: 
- Do I show the limitations of CoPilot, LLMS? 
- Or do I show my human input in it..what do I do with it? 
- I want to make a tool — that is specific for websites, also political 

— DALLE 

FLORA 
- Or do I show my human input in it..what do I do with it? 
- 

OFFLINE / 
- What is present tense feminism? 
- Should feminism be online? 
- Tiqqun the cybernetic offline 
- Should a feminist website self-destruct? 
- What is the feminist idea of privacy? 
- Saying NO 
- Vision == visualising a site (already implicit)
- WHAT WOULD IT BE 
- Interactive element needs to be there 
- IRL + ONLINE 
- Realtime — present — LIVEFEED 


IS THIS ABOUT FEMINISM REALLY? 
HOW CAN PRESENT, IN GENERAL, BE INTEGRATED BY TECHNOLOGY? CAN IT? 
WEBSITES LIKE COMING SOON ARE ABOUT THE PRESENT, BUT REFERRING TO THE FUTURE

NEXT UP: 
- keep experimenting
- what to show?? THE PROOF OF WORK IS THERE IS conceptualise
- WHAT IS WEB'S NORM, UNDERSTANDING OF WEB DEVELOPMENT  

- what is a website? How will a website evolve in the future? 
- intervention into that: norm...show its limitations, how it could be built to make my own example
- indispensable -- when you visit a website, it's not the same experience without the human

WHAT IS A WEBSITE THAT IS PRESENT

- What about our present is worth digitising? — WORKSHOP 
- What about a LEAVING SOON website? — online clearance

Reading Silvio
- over-politization of design practice
- Being political is not a process, but a badge
- ISSUING Statement/manifesto requires less time and energy than building a product — hence graphic designers = critical actors
- Applies to all practices today?

That’s why I struggle to show the political lack of AI
- I don’t want to be a designer making a political statement without having a process (which I doubt I will with an AI bcs that’s its lmitation — only good for technical negotiation)
- I also don’t want to problematise unnecessarily just to offer some bland solution 

I want to build a website that shows exactly how I work with AI:
- PRESENT MOMENT WEBSITE — website that listens and talks
- Collects hours put into making it (compares it to how much time it would take with a human) 

Continue — sound + workshop 
— some response 
- Color change 
- Syntax web development 
- Disappears 
- Leaving soon 

FLORA'S WEEK 
- Can it integrate live component, like vector and livestream
- calculate distance between feminism + another concept
