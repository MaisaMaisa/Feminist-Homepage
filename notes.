Notes on Feminist Webpage generated by AI 

- Generic contains Header, Body, Footer
- In the About section, the most interesting part it gave me was Work in Progress and some blanks
- It is very kind — user friendly 
- Pretty knowledgeable of the feminism and cyberfeminism histories
- 2022 as a copyright 
- Colors bright pink 
- Favicon venus symbol

Directions to take: 
- Unfinished elements
- Constantly available website
- How to design unavailability? That is not maintenance mode? 
- How to integrate that in a website and when does it become unavailable? 
- Would its unavailability hide the glitches or hide the content? 
- Can it become URGENT related to historic events like protests? 
- Can it become a tool for not always available information ??
- Does its code become unavailable too? 

Next week: 
- I want to explore unavailability — in a new branch 
- 

— WHAT IS WORK IN PROGRESS? 
— make more websites — 
— comparing the code 
— make my website feminist? —>

AESTHETIC INCOMPLETENESS
— aesthetic can’t represent incompleteness of decision-making— it always needs a human to make a decision that it can represent. Randomness of decisions or LEAVING IT FOR LATER

2 directions: 
- Do I show the limitations of CoPilot, LLMS? 
- Or do I show my human input in it..what do I do with it? 
- I want to make a tool — that is specific for websites, also political
