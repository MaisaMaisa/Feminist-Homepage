    <p>MaisaMaisa: if this website is a work in progress, what is a completed website?</p>
    <p>AI: A completed website is one that has all its intended features implemented and functioning correctly. This includes:
        <ul>
            <li>All pages and sections are fully developed with content, images, and other necessary elements. &#10003</li>
            <li>All links, buttons, and forms are working as expected. &#10003</li>
            <li>The website is fully responsive, meaning it works well on all devices and screen sizes. &#10003</li>
            <li>It has been tested for usability and accessibility to ensure it's easy to use and accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. &#10007;</li>
            <li>It has been optimized for search engines (SEO). &#10007;</li>
            <li>It has a clear, intuitive navigation system. &#10003</li>
            <li>It has been thoroughly tested for bugs and errors, and all known issues have been resolved. &#126;</li>
            <li>It has a consistent look and feel across all pages. &#126;</li>
            <li>It has a secure connection (HTTPS) and follows other best practices for web security. &#10007;</li>
            <li>It has been launched and is accessible to the public via a specific domain name. &#10003</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>MaisaMaisa: I see..</p>
    <p>AI: However, it's important to note that even "completed" websites often require ongoing maintenance and updates to keep the content fresh, fix any issues that arise, and add new features as needed.
    </p>
    <p>MaisaMaisa: does maintenance make it a website in progress?</p>
    <p>AI: In a sense, yes. Websites are never truly "finished" in the sense that they can always be improved, updated, and expanded upon. However, once a website has all its intended features implemented and is functioning correctly, it can be considered "complete" in the sense that it serves its intended purpose and is accessible to users.</p>
    <p>MaisaMaisa: can you make a website that is intentionally incomplete?</p>
    <p>AI: Yes, it is possible to create a website that is intentionally incomplete, for example, as a placeholder or teaser for a future project. This might include a landing page with minimal information and a "coming soon" message, or a website with limited functionality and content that is gradually expanded over time. However, it's important to communicate clearly with users about the website's status and future plans to avoid confusion or frustration.</p>
