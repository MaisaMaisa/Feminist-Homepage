                        <h2>History of Feminism</h2>
                        <p>Feminism is a social and political movement that advocates for women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men. The movement has roots in the 19th century, when women began to challenge their assigned roles in society.</p>
                        <p>The feminist movement has evolved through several waves. The first wave, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, focused on legal inequalities and fought for women's suffrage. The second wave, in the 1960s and 1970s, broadened the debate to include cultural inequalities and gender norms. The third wave, from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, sought to challenge or avoid what it deemed the second wave's essentialist definitions of femininity.</p>
                        <p>Today, feminism continues to focus on eliminating gender inequalities and promoting women's rights, with an increased focus on intersectionality, recognizing that women's experiences are shaped not just by their gender, but also by factors such as race, socioeconomic status, and more.</p>
