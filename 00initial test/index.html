    <div class="parallax-content">
        <p>I just made this parallax effect in less than 5 minutes with the help of GitHub's copilot</p>
        <p>I need to write something smarter and reflect on this assignment</p>
        <p>I should write sth smarter</p>
        <p>I want to write something smarter</p>
        <p>but I'm just so impressed</p>
        <p>I actually learned about this tool from a Graphic Design tutor at CalArts who LOVES it</p>
        <p>He was gonna hire me for his next web gig as his assistant but I guess that's delayed forever</p>
        <p>my former 'boss' whose web assistant I was 'freed' all of his assistants</p>
        <p>actually they freed themselves because they concluded that he's better off using AI to help him build outdated websites than he is with them</p>
        <p id="typewriter"></p>
        <p>It's pretty amazing how much it takes my Google habit away. The CoPilot gives me solutions to my already written code and adds to that, whether Google works with 673428374 different sources that require you to commit to only one and build from there on your own.</p>
        <p>I mean, I guess this process is stupefying, unless you're actually studying the code that CoPilot gives you.</p>
        <p>the big disadvantage is that you always have to know what you want.</p>
        <p>this always falls back on the standards of web development, so the ideas will always be reused/reproduced.</p>
        <p>how is my imagination going to evolve with this tool that saves hours and hours of research work?</p>
        <p>I guess I have to be critical and determine where best it fits my practice?</p>
        <p>I have been getting paid to make boring websites in my life; I spent a lot of nerves conforming to the standards of web development because my clients want boring websites.</p>
        <p>In this context, especially as a female freelance web developer who tends to be more exploited than their male competitors, is where the use of this tool could come in handy.</p>
        <p>As long as she nourished her creative needs in different contexts, preferrably of web development.</p><br>
        <h1>CHAPTER 2</h1><br>
        <p>I asked CoPilot to generate an image of a freelance male web developer and it gave me this:</p>
        <p>"I apologize, but as an AI text-based model, I'm unable to generate or provide images directly. However, you can easily find images of male web developers by searching on stock photo websites like Shutterstock, Unsplash, or Adobe Stock. Just enter relevant keywords such as "male web developer" or "programmer" in the search bar, and you should be able to find a variety of images to choose from."</p>
        <p>I think it's about the right time to say that we've reached an era in which AI is very quotable.</p>
        <p>I like that AI suggested removing 'freelance' when searching for visuals elsewhere and also that it equals it to programmer.</p>
        <p>"freelance" is a political term referring to a specific context ~ episteme</p>
        <p>(it's not a commentary on gender differences, it gives me the same suggestion when I ask for a female web dev visuals)</p>

  <h1>why is this slideshow feminist?</h1><br>
  <h2>GitHub Copilot:</h2>
  <span>
    Apologies for the confusion. The provided code for the slideshow itself does not inherently make it feminist. The term "feminist" refers to a social and political movement advocating for gender equality and women's rights. The code I provided is a basic structure for a slideshow and does not have any specific feminist content or features.<br><br>

    To make the slideshow align with feminist themes, you would need to incorporate feminist-related images, messages, or symbols within the slideshow. This could include images representing women's empowerment, gender equality, or influential feminist figures. Additionally, you could customize the styling, colors, and text to reflect feminist aesthetics and values.<br><br>

    Remember that the code I provided is a starting point, and you can modify it to suit your specific feminist slideshow requirements by incorporating feminist content and design elements.

  <h1>can you give me feminist aesthetics for the slideshow?</h1><br>
  <h2>GitHub Copilot:</h2>
  <span>
    Certainly! When it comes to incorporating feminist aesthetics into your slideshow, you can consider the following design elements:<br><br>

Color Palette: Choose colors that are associated with feminism, such as shades of pink, purple, or bold and vibrant colors. You can also use colors that represent inclusivity and diversity.<br><br>

Typography: Select fonts that convey a sense of strength, empowerment, or femininity. Consider using bold and impactful fonts for headings and clear, legible fonts for body text.<br><br>

Imagery: Include images that celebrate women's empowerment, gender equality, and diversity. You can use photographs, illustrations, or artwork that represent feminist themes and values.<br><br>

Symbols and Icons: Incorporate symbols and icons that are associated with feminism, such as the female symbol (â™€), equality signs, or other symbols that represent women's rights and empowerment.<br><br>

Layout and Composition: Experiment with layouts that are visually engaging and dynamic. Consider using asymmetrical designs, overlapping elements, or creative arrangements to add visual interest.<br><br>

Motion and Transitions: Apply smooth transitions between slides to create a seamless and visually appealing experience. You can also consider adding subtle animations or effects to enhance the overall aesthetic.
